# Three.JS-Webpack-Boilerplate-v4

By [JoccaWeb](http://joccaweb.nl/ "My frontend portfolio"). 

This project assumes intermediate knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.<br>
Suitable for [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) beginners. 
I learned a lot from several online sources.<br>
